Keras/Tensorflow implementation of *Deep Image Homography Estimation* by D. DeTone, T. Malisiewicz, and A. Rabinovich (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.03798.pdf)

The paper presented a deep convolutional neural network to estimate the relative homography between a pair of images. Only the regression network was implemented in this repository. Also implemented in this repository is their proposed method of generating datasets from images.
